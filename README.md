# IAL_Homework_1
The following three examples were in the first homework assignment:

-C201: one-way linked linear list 

-C203: character queue in field 

-C206: implementation of bidirectionally linked linear list 

The task was to complete the function bodies in files c201.c, c203.c and c206.c and then submit these three files via STUDIS (unpackaged and encoded in UTF-8).
